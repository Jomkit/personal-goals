Personal Goals

I was inspired to open source a list of my personal goals thanks to Una Kravetz! Along with her original blurb, check out her guide below.

## This Week's Focus: Web Development

Hot off the heels of my camping trip, I find myself hungry to learn more and get things done. Not exactly what I wanted to get out of the rest from programming, but I guess the lesson I learned from taking a break is that a single big vacation from the grind isn't sustainable. 

This week I'm gonna focus on more web development things, as I've been shirking those responsibilities as of late in favor of embedded software and learning C++. 

### Things I'll do This Week:

- [ ] Get two PR's pushed in Glowrift-Duskhall (open-source project)
- [ ] Read [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/)
- [ ] Update my portfolio website 
- [ ] Learn about Next.js
- [ ] Write another Arduino program, this time incorporating other parts like maybe a motor
- [ ] Write a blog post
- [ ] Put two hours into studying C++ (0 so far)
