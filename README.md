Personal Goals
==============

I was inspired to open source a list of my personal goals thanks to Una Kravetz! Along with her original blurb, check out her guide below.

[Original] Personal goals made open source for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning. Learn more about it [here](http://una.im/personal-goals-guide).

## This Week's Focus: Open Source

I've been busy with life the last couple of weeks and have been regrettably shirking my open-source responsibilities, but I'm getting back on the horse this week.

### Things I'll do This Week:

- [x] Read some programming articles on my reading list backlog
- [x] Read some embedded software articles, also from my reading list backlog
- [ ] Write a blog post (topic undetermined)
- [ ] Program a simple arduino project, like a button press counter

### Things I'll Do this month (July 2025):

- [ ] Finish Reading [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter00/)
- [ ] Finish Reading [Search Inside Yourself](https://www.amazon.com/Search-Inside-Yourself-Unexpected-Achieving/dp/0062116932)
- [ ] Set up my raspberry pi
- [ ] Do some journaling
