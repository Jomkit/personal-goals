Personal Goals

I was inspired to open source a list of my personal goals thanks to Una Kravetz! Along with her original blurb, check out her guide below.

## This Week's Focus: WebGL / More Open Source

I'm juggling a lot of things right now, but I've wanted to learn WebGL for the longest time, and I have some ideas for incorporating it into other projects, so I want to put more focus on that this week. Likewise for open-source, I want to contribute more.

### Things I'll do This Week:

- [x] Go to a networking event
- [x] Go to botanical garden
- [ ] Get two PR's pushed in Glowrift-Duskhall (open-source project)
- [ ] Write another Arduino program, this time incorporating other parts like maybe a motor
- [x] Write a blog post (a guide to PlatformIO setup)
- [ ] Put two hours into studying C++ (1 so far)
- [ ] Put two hours into studying WebGL (0 so far)
- [ ] Finish a simple project (~4 hours?) showcasing WebGL
- [ ] Look into how other people have added animations to their websites

### Things I'll Do this month (July 2025):

- [ ] Finish Reading [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter00/)
