# Resources

For resources I use, and resources I want to check out

## Tools I use
- [TMUX](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started) (aka terminal multiplexer)
    - great for multitasking in the terminal window, I often use this to start up dev servers for backend and frontend servers for my web apps. Also great for separating the terminal environment by projects, if for example you needed node 22 in one project vs. node 18 or something for another.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - If you haven't been using this yet, you should totally try out VS Code. It's nice to shop around with IDE's, but in the end you should stick to one overall. VS Code is my primary IDE for development.
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
    - Despite what I just said above, I've been trying out neovim and loving it so far. It's got a bit of a learning curve, but after you go through the vim tutor (open vim or nvim and type `:tutor`) you'll immediately pick up enough useful skills to play around with some simple projects in neovim. 
    - For me the main perk is being able to program just using the keyboard. Another nice thing is how quickly you can run something in neovim.

## Resources for Learning

- Learning C++: https://www.learncpp.com/
- Learning Java: https://java-programming.mooc.fi/ 

## Resources I still need to check out
- [ ] [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) - For incredible 2D animations
- [ ] [three.js](https://threejs.org/) - for incredible *3D* animations
- [ ] [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/) - Web animations in react, because I wanted to add some animation to icons and other "small" things in my web apps. Compared to the above two, which seem more full-scale to me
- [ ] [svgator](https://www.svgator.com/blog/) - Tool for creating svg animations I think, paid resource with a free tier. Want to check it out for now, and see if it's any good 
- [ ] [wick editor](https://www.wickeditor.com/#/) - an open-source tool for animations
