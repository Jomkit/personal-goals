# Learning Ideas for the Future
I often come across articles and news about things I want to learn more about. Sometimes I jump right into them, disregarding whether or not I need that right now for whatever projects or personal goals I'm working toward at the time. Other articles I save in a reading list. 

Here, I'm gonna try my best to save some of the things I come across so that I can both share this with others, and also leave it somewhere I'll hopefully come back to.

## Programming Languages
I used to think I'd be done with just two or three languages, but it turns out there's a whole lot left to learn. As a polyglot of human languages, I've long since gotten over the concern of becoming a jack of all trades master of none. So here are some languages I'd like to learn.

- [ ] Assembly (MIPS/ARM/x86): I'll probably start with MIPS, but I've always wanted to learn assembly, and 2026 is the year I plan to learn them.
- [ ] Eiffel: Eiffel is an objected-oriented programming language which first appeared in 1986, but which I've heard has OOP concepts that have appeared in many other languages such as C#. I was reading a stack overflow thread when one of the comments recommended this for understanding how OOP has developed over the years (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2635086/mips-processors-are-they-still-in-use-which-other-architecture-should-i-learn).
- [ ] Haskell: A purely functional language that first appeared in 1990, I've heard of this one pretty often while listening to podcasts and in discussion. In the same thread above the same commenter mentioned learning Haskell as a good way to understand how functional programming has developed over the years (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2635086/mips-processors-are-they-still-in-use-which-other-architecture-should-i-learn)
