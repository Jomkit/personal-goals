- [X] Program a simple arduino project, like a button press counter


### Things I Didn't Get to/Finish:

- [ ] Finish Reading [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/Chapter00/)

### Additional Things I Did:

- [x] Set up PlatformIO extension on VSCode
- [x] Watch Cherno's videos on C++ concepts (specifically C++ Compiler, Linker, and simple pointers)
- [x] Made a simple SOS program on the Arduino Uno R3 based on the basic blink program
- [x] Fixed a minor issue that popped up in one of the open-source projects I contribute to

## Next Week's Focus: 

## Things I'll Do Next Week:

- [ ] Go to a networking event
- [ ] Go to botanical garden
- [ ] Write another Arduino program, this time incorporating other parts like maybe a motor
- [ ] Write a blog post (a guide to PlatformIO setup)
- [ ] Put two hours into studying C++ (0 so far)
- [ ] Put an hour into studying WebGL (0 so far)

### Week in Review

Good first start I think, I like being more mindful of what I do and my accomplishments. Looking back on things, I feel like I could have done more, but I am glad to write down and see my progress. I'm looking forward to trying to do more this upcoming week. What I also need to work on is recognizing accomplishments outside of the goals I set for myself, and writing them down.
I spent some time looking at one of the tasks I've been dragging my feet on for the main open-source project I work on. I haven't made the progress I wanted to, but I did fix another issue that popped up so I felt pretty happy about that.
